# Gameboy CatchMonsters
 
This is a monster catcher project for use with GB Studio 3.0 to produce a working, and legal,
game boy game that can be used as a base for other games.
Individual assets may be under various different licenses, but I try to use only public domain or creative commons.

Note that I have a very dark sense of humor.
The planned storyline for the sample game is you are a wannabe cop/enforcer in a world with only one corporation, Omnicorp, which genetically engineers creatures that feel no pain, arguing this makes it acceptable to eat and battle them.

Current working features:
* Choosing a start monster, in this case a duck, a cat, or a mouse.
* Starting a battle with many different monsters (actually mostly just generic animal sprites at the moment).
* HP going down with an animation and ending the battle at low health.
* Different HP and stats for different creatures, you can see your creature's type.
* Typed attacks
* Roaming across maps to new places
* A single map with a following critter example.
* Basic saving.

While I am aware there was another example monster catcher project, it seemed to be for 2.0 and wasn't very developed.
The combat system currently is set up so you win every time, which isn't very interesting, but it's a start.

There mayyy be an issue trying to use music from this repo as github changes line endings.

The python based Tuxemon project, from which the Omnicorp concept was borrowed and the current name for the creatures, Tuxemon. This project may eventually use some /actual/ Tuxemon if it ends up going anywhere.
